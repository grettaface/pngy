PNGY
====

Pngy is a javascript object that allows for highly controllable png animations.

It has no dependencies other than Javascript. As long as you provide it with a spritesheet that it expects, it will do the rest

It provides users with much more control over animations without needing to use things like canvas. 

It gives you the flexibility to do things like:

- Play a linear animation with a png sprite sheet
- Play specific portions of that sprite sheet
- Play them in reverse  
- Adjust the frame rate
- Remove the animation from the DOM
- AND MORE!

I cannot test on every platform but everything that I have tested on has worked. That includes:

- Chrome (current)
- Safari (current)
- Firefox (current)
- IE 8+
- iOS 6+
- Android 2.3+
- Basically anything that supports background images and background position which should be IE4+ and EVERYTHING else.
